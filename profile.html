    <div class="aboutMe">
        <p>I’m a second-year Computer Science student at <b>Assumption University of Thailand</b> with a strong interest in building practical tech projects. I enjoy working with Java, MySQL, and AI-related tools, and I’ve joined several hackathons where I explored ideas like agent-selection systems and POS applications. I like learning new skills, experimenting with creative projects, and improving my knowledge step by step. I’m also open to new opportunities for growth, including transferring to a university in Europe to continue my studies.</p>
